> *"Inch by inch, anything's a cinch"*

Simple console applications are the traditional world within which most developers learn how to code. The quintessential first program is a one-liner:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
```

The **`Console`** class in .NET is the standard text input/output tool for communicating in a terminal or shell environment.

The up-side of using console applications is that they are simple to work with and provide quick-n-easy user I/O. The downside is that it's easy to get mired in the kinds of linear and procedural mindsets that can quickly limit our ability to handle complexity in our applications.

## Separation of Concerns

One of the early things to learn in software development is the concept of the "separation of concerns". This concept refers to the notion that we don't want disparate aspects of our software to be heavily intertwined or interconnected. Rather, we want different parts of our application to be "loosely connected".

## A) Methods as Reusable Code

So that we don't have to copy/paste the same snippets of code over and over, we can create methods to 

- [ ] ReadInt()
- [ ] ReadDouble()
- [ ] ReadChar()
- [ ] ReadText()

## ?) Projects as Reusable Code

How to re-use in another project? Traditional Copy/Paste.

## ?) NuGet Packages as Reusable Code

- [ ] Roll-your-own vs use 3rd-party packages
  - [ ] [Sharprompt](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sharprompt)

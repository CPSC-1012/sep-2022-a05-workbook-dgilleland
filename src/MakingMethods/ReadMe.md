# Making Methods and Modularizing Solutions

Consider the following problem.

> Let's create a program that will compare the areas of two shapes and identify which is bigger.
> 
> - The user can identify which shape they want: Circle, Square, Triangle, or Rectangle
> - Formulas:
>      - Circle: Area = PI * r^2
>      - Square: Area = side ^ 2
>      - Triangle: Area = 1/2 * base * height
>      - Rectangle: Area = length * width
> - The user can repeat the action of comparing shapes, pressing "X" to exit
> - Validate all user input
> - Handle all dimensions as double data types

# Fraction

Requirements:

Get a fraction value by having the user enter the numerator and then the denominator. From that information

- Display the string representation of the fraction, as "numerator/denominator"
- Display the numeric value of the fraction (as a real number)
- Display the reciprocal of the fraction
- Display the numerator and denominator

> :exclamation: Remember to affix the sign for negative fractions onto the numerator only

Prompt for an additional fraction from the user. Also ask for some math operation (add/subtract/multiply/divide); use a menu for this. Perform the appropriate math to get the result of the operation:

- *First Fraction* [operation] *Second Fraction*

Then, do the following for the result:

- Display the string representation of the result, as "numerator/denominator"
- Display the numeric value of the result (as a real number)
- Display the reciprocal of the result
- Display the numerator and denominator
- Identify if the fraction is a proper fraction
- Express the fraction as a mixed number string

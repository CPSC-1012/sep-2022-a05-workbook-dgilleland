# Stock Item

Requirements:

- Should get the name, cost and profit margin of the stock item
- Should calculate the price of the item, to the nearest cent, using the profit margin as a percent (a profit margin of 45 means 45%)
- Use the rounding where values under a half-cent are rounded down and values greater than or equal to a half-cent are rounded up
- Should recognize when the stock item is priced at cost (that is, the profit margin is zero)
- Should recognize when the stock item is priced below cost (that is, the profit margin is negative)

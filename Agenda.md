# Agenda

Here I will be making notes about what I will be teaching in class.


## Monday, Sep 12

> *At the end of this topic/class, you should be able to:*
> 
> - Install VS Code *user installation version* on your lab computer
> - Access your student workbook from school and from home
> - Create and manage projects in your student workbook
> - Perform version control operations in VS Code

> :memo: **Side-Note:** The [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) is another great resource I would recommend.

## Wednesday, Sep 14


> *At the end of this topic/class, you should be able to:*
> 
> - Use the `Math` class functions for common formulas and values
> - Perform arithmetic operations and calculations on numeric values
> - Perform User I/O
> - Convert textual information into numeric information (where possible)

- **Demos:**
  - [Square](https://programming-0101.github.io/TheBook/Topic/E/Examples/Square.html) calculations - given the $side$
    - $\text{area} = side^{2}$
    - $\text{perimeter} = side \cdot 4$
  - [Circle](https://programming-0101.github.io/TheBook/Topic/E/Examples/Circle.html) calculations - given the $diameter$
    - $\text{radius} = \frac{diameter}{2}$
    - $\text{circumference} = \pi \cdot diameter$
    - $\text{area} = \pi \cdot radius^{2}$
- **Practice:**
  - [**Cylinder**](https://programming-0101.github.io/TheBook/Topic/E/Practice/Cylinder.html) calculations - given the $radius$ and the $height$, find the [volume](https://www.google.com/search?q=Volume+of+a+Cylinder) and the [surface area](https://www.google.com/search?q=Surface+Area+of+a+Cylinder). The formulas are:
    - $\text{Volume of a Cylinder} = pi \cdot r^2 \cdot h$
    - $\text{Surface Area of a Cylinder} = 2 \cdot pi \cdot r^2 + 2 \cdot pi \cdot r \cdot h$
  - [**Cone**](https://programming-0101.github.io/TheBook/Topic/E/Practice/Cone.html) calculations - given the base radius $r$ and the height $h$, find the [volume](https://www.google.com/search?q=Volume+of+a+Cone) and the [surface area](https://www.google.com/search?q=Surface+Area+of+a+Cone). The formulas are:
    - $\text{Volume of a Cone} = \frac{1}{3} \cdot pi \cdot r^2 \cdot h$
    - $\text{Surface Area of a Cone} = \pi \cdot r \cdot (r + \sqrt{h^2 + r^2})$

## Friday, Sep 16


> *At the end of this topic/class, you should be able to:*
> 
> - Select your active project for OmniSharp in Visual Studio Code
> - Describe the "Prompt" algorithm and how it is implemented in C#
> - Apply `use static` statements to simplify the use of static members of common classes (such as the `Console` class)
> - Follow proper coding standards for C#
>   - e.g.: `thisIsAVariable`, `ThisIsATypeOrClassMember` and `THIS_IS_A_CONSTANT`
> - Explain how and why constants in our programs are a better alternative to "ad-hoc" literal values
> - Perform special arithmetic tasks using the Math class
>   - Rounding, Power, etc.

- **Demos:**
  - Re-write the [Cylinder](./src/005/Program.cs) and [Cone](./src/006/Program.cs) examples to `use static System.Console`
  - [Quadratic Equation](https://programming-0101.github.io/TheBook/Topic/E/Examples/QuadraticEquation.html)

$$
x = \frac{-b \plusmn \sqrt{b^{2} - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

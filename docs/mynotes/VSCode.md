# Using VS Code

## Side Panel Controls

### ![Explorer Icon](./images/VSCode-SidePanel-Explorer.png) Explorer

The explorer allows you to view the files and folders in your currently active folder. I recommend always working in an open folder. So, if you see the following image, just click on either "Open Folder" or "Clone Repository".

### ![Source Control Icon](./images/VSCode-SidePanel-SourceControl.png) Source Control

Read about [git support](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/versioncontrol#_git-support), especially the use of the **Source Control** side panel.
